The method for accessing price data from the markets I have compiled are 
as follows, and all the data comes from GOOGLEFINANCE functions available 
directly in google sheet. They are transfered to CSV's as follows.

To download market data from Google Finance, use the GOOGLEFINANCE function in Google Sheets, specifying the ticker, attribute, start date, end date, and interval, then download the sheet as a CSV file. 
Here's a more detailed explanation:
1. Access Google Sheets:
Open a new or existing Google Sheet. 
You can do this through Google Drive (click the "+" New button and choose "Google Sheets") or by going directly to sheets.google.com. 
2. Use the GOOGLEFINANCE Function:
In a cell, type =GOOGLEFINANCE("ticker", "attribute", start_date, end_date, "interval").
ticker: The ticker symbol for the security (e.g., "GOOG" for Alphabet).
attribute: The specific data you want (e.g., "price", "priceopen", "high", "low", "volume", "marketcap").
start\_date: The date to start retrieving data from (e.g., DATE(2023,1,1) for January 1, 2023).
end\_date: The date to end retrieving data (e.g., DATE(2023,12,31) for December 31, 2023).
interval: The frequency of data retrieval (e.g., "DAILY", "WEEKLY").
Example: =GOOGLEFINANCE("GOOG", "price", DATE(2023,1,1), DATE(2023,12,31), "DAILY") 
3. Download as CSV:
Once the data is pulled into your sheet, go to "File" > "Download" > "Comma-separated values (.csv)".
This will download the sheet as a CSV file containing the market data. 
4. Additional Notes:
Historical Data: You can access historical data by specifying start_date and end_date. 
Real-Time Data: If you don't specify start_date and end_date, you'll get real-time data. 
Attributes: Explore different attributes like "priceopen", "high", "low", "volume", "marketcap", "tradetime", "datadelay", "volumeavg", "pe", "eps", "high52", "low52". 
Limitations: The data is not for financial industry professional use or use by other professionals at non-financial firms (including government entities). 
Google Finance Function: The GOOGLEFINANCE function is a built-in function in Google Sheets, so you don't need to install anything.
